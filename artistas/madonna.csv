61,Confessions,/madonna/confessions.html,,"CLOUD: I was three feet the floor, gasping for air trying to realease my father's hands from my throat. I looked into his eyes and wondered if my feet would ever touch the floor again. Have you ever been hit so hard that is sends your body diying across the room? We all fall to the floor at some point. It's how you pick yourself up - that's the real challenge. Isn't it? I've açways lived in my own world. I danced to escape my troubles. I've learned that there's light, even in the darkest places. I can't blame my father for anything. You can't rely on other people to make you happy. But l know deep down inside he loved me.   SOFIA: There was a time l suffered so much l wanted toget it out of me. I would cut my arms, not to kill myself. I don't want to die. I know I an lucky to be on this earth. I did it so the physical pain woul cam the pain that was eating me inside. Not was erased. I live with my past tucked away deep inside of me. It comes out, an explosion, and it invades me. I believe we are messengers on earth I believe in algels. I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered tah much to become who I am today.    HYPNOSIS: Now you have to realize, no only do I have a family, but now I have a shole hood - and that's power. But I ain't no grimy ass nigga. I was never out to kill anybody - especially when I made that decision to gang band. I just wanted to fit in, But one day I was forced to do something that made me open my eyes. I realized that this shit ain't no gang. One of the hommies got popped, and I was pressured to doing my first drive by. It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to ser me up. Me and my bro, we was headed vack to the 8 block and some hommies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere. We pulled up to the corner and he placed a chunky ass gun to my mouth. He said, 'you know ehat to do with it.' It's time to get it poppin' for the hood. But I wasn't about to kille anybody.",Madonna

""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query. Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.  Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore. I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!  Count your blessings, one, two, three I just hate keeping score. Any number is fine with me As long as it's more As long as it's more!  I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition I find counting a bore. Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting. [More! More!]  I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before Got my guy and my sky of blue, Now, however, I own the view. More is better than nothing, true But nothing's better than more, more, more Nothing's better than more.  One is fun, why not two? And if you like two, you might as well have four, And if you like four, why not a few Why not a slew [More! More!]  If you've got a little, why not a lot? Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle. Every jot and tittle adds to the pot Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle. [More! More!]  Never say when, never stop at plenty, If it's gonna rain, let it pour. Happy with ten, happier with twenty If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?  Or does that sound too greedy? That's not greed, no, indeedy That's just stocking the store Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard. [More! More!]  Each possession you possess Helps your spirits to soar. That's what's soothing about excess Never settle for something less. Something's better than nothing, yes! But nothing's better than more, more more [Except all, all, all] Except all, all, all Except once you have it all [have it all] You may find all else above [find all else above] That though things are bliss, There's one thing you miss, and that's More! More! More! More! More! More! ",Madonna

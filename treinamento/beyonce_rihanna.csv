Consider them my protégé, How much I think they should pay. Instead of being gracious, They violated and made you wait. I never been a hater still I love them, Yeah I graze the way. Some say they so yay and No they couldn't even work on labor day. It aint that they black or white, Their hands of area in shades of grey. I'm west side anyway, Even if I left the day it fades away. Some move away to make a way not move away Cause they afraid. I'll go back to the hood And all you ever did was hate away. I pray for patience But they make me want to face away.

Where you from, who you know, What you make and what kind of car you in. Seems as though you lost sight Of what's important with the positive. And checks until your bank account, And you're about poverted. Your values is a disarrayed, Prioritized are horribly. Unhappy with the riches cause you pis-pone morraly. Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning. And we might be full of ourselves all of a sudden Aren't we?  (rihanna): You're gonna be a shining star, With fancy clothes And fancy car-ars.
